            Hey it's me, @(_self.Name)!
            Check out my <a href="/jorson/life">Blog</a>, <a href="/jorson/games">Games</a>, and recent <a href="/jorson/food">Foodventures</a>.

            <p id="who-am-i">
                <br />I am a Christian, a husband, a father, and a Computer Scientist working.
                Despite not internet until my mid teen years, I fell in love with video games and digital media growing
                up.
                <br /><br />
                I discovered my passion for programming later on in life when I got into college.
                I didn't know how to type when I got into college, so I had a rough go of it at the beginning.
                By Sophomore year of college, I had mastered typing and my hopeless obsession with programming began.
                <br /><br />
                These days, I am employed by <a href="https://www.purestorage.com">Pure Storage</a>,
                and I spend most of my free time working on weird crap like this website.

                <br />
                Like most normal humans, I care a lot about my family, including my wife, my baby daughter (not pictured), and three cats (cat named Fish not pictured). I also care greatly about games,
                both digital and physical, and I program in much of my spare time. I greatly value education, so many of my
                projects are aimed at either improving my own skillset or knowledge on various topics.
                I am currently working on my immutable programming language <a href="https://github.com/ExoKomodo/Daybreak">Daybreak</a>.
                <br /><br />
                I hope that the whole world will continue to embrace tech more intimately. Through my own love for technology and
                learning, I hope my burning passion will encourage others to push forward in pursuit of their dreams.
