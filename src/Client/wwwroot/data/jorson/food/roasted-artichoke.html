          Heat oven to 400°F
        </li>
        <li class="recipe-direction-item">
          Use a knife to slice off the bottom 1/2-inch (or more, if you’d like) of the artichoke stems, and the top 1 inch of the artichoke globes (the leaves on top).  Remove and discard any small leaves toward the bottoms of the stems.  Rinse the artichokes with water.
        </li>
        <li class="recipe-direction-item">
          Slice the artichokes in half vertically.  Use a spoon to scoop out the fuzzy “choke” in the middle of the artichoke.  Then use kitchen shears to trim about 1/4/-inch off the pointy tips of each of the artichoke leaves (so that they don’t poke you when you eat them).  Rub a lemon wedge all over the entire surface of each artichoke half, to prevent browning.
        </li>
        <li class="recipe-direction-item">
          Place the artichoke halves in a baking dish or on a baking sheet cut-side-up.  Brush the cut sides of the artichokes evenly with the olive oil.  Then fill the cavities evenly with the garlic, followed by a few small sprigs of the fresh herbs.  Season with salt and pepper.
        </li>
        <li class="recipe-direction-item">
          Flip the artichokes over, using the herbs to help hold in the garlic, so that they are cut-side-down.  Brush the tops of the artichokes with oil, and season with salt and pepper.
        </li>
        <li class="recipe-direction-item">
          Bake uncovered for 15 minutes.  Then remove and cover the pan with aluminum foil, and bake for an additional 25-35 minutes, or until the artichokes are tender and the leaves pull off easily.
        </li>
        <li class="recipe-direction-item">
          Place the tray on a cooling rack.  Carefully remove, discard the herbs (or stir them into your dipping sauce for extra flavor), and drizzle the artichokes with extra lemon juice.
        </li>
        <li class="recipe-direction-item">
          Serve the roasted artichokes warm with your desired dipping sauce.
