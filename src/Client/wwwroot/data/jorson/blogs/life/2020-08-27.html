  <p>Have you ever been playing Blaseball when something really tugged at your heart and made you ask, "Where am I going
    to play Papa's Pizzeria after December 2020?"
    <br></br> Many browsers are <a href="https://support.google.com/chrome/a/answer/7084871">ending Flash support</a>
    come December of this year. My generation grew up on these games, and I would argue that these games paved the way
    for the modern indie video game market. The newest generation won't have these games, but instead has the Android
    and Apple app stores. Maybe I have nostalgia blinders, but I really do believe that the mediocre titles of the Flash
    era either matched, or at least came near to matching the quality of modern mobile games. Many influential mobile
    games even started as Flash, such as Kingdom Rush, Canabalt, and Bloons Tower Defense.
    <br></br>
    Flash is not inherently good. From a technical standpoint, we have made incredible progress in enabling developers
    to build their creations beyond the likes of
    Flash. The spirit of Flash is what was special. Before commercialization and ad profits entered the picture, these
    games were made by developers with simple wishes to share their dreams with others.
    <br></br>
    I work on games in the hopes of pushing myself and others to do this very thing. In the memory of Flash, I will
    continue to recreate my
    favorite Flash games on this site, and hopefully bring some unique creations up along the way.
