    Oh dear Lord there has been a lot since last time. Amongst an insurrection on the US capitol and a stock war over
    GameStop, my wife and I bought a house and got a third cat, Fish.
    <br></br>
    I learned a few new programming languages including two new favorites of mine: <a
    href="https://www.scala-lang.org">Scala</a> and <a href="https://www.nim-lang.org">Nim<a> (<i>All good languages
    seem to have website domains of the form www.[language name here]-lang.com</i>). I mostly ported the Komodo
    game engine to Scala using LibGDX and only gave up once Java UI threads were getting in the way of easy UI
    development. It was fun and all, but I think the real winner and final home for the Komodo engine is with Nim.
    <br></br>
    Nim satisfies my urge to write what looks like pseudocode while enjoying the benefits of a statically typed and
    compiled language. No attempt by the Nim developers to make a compiler smarter than two of some of the largest
    open-source communities (<a href="https://gcc.gnu.org/">GCC</a> and <a href="https://clang.llvm.org/">Clang</a>),
    but instead harnesses these behemoths by simply generating C-family code and passing it off to your local system
    compiler. With a powerful macro system, Komodo has never looked better and I am excited to see what can be done with
    Nim and Raylib.
    <br></br>
    Apart from code, my life has changed in other ways. My teammates at work left for other teams or other
    companies, leaving me alone to develop and maintain an app servicing a workforce around ~2,000 strong. I am
    excited to say that this will not be the case forever, as I will be transitioning to an SRE position once my
    project is ready to hand off to a new team. Work is great. Life is great. For those who cannot say these same
    things for themselves, reach out to those who love you and have faith that this will all come to an end
    eventually.
