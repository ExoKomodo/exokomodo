    The morning has been an interesting one. I woke up around 11 am after a late night of <a
       href="https://mst3k.com">Mystery Science Theater 3000</a>. I got up, dressed, and went to do the dishes. I got
    to the end and lo, some unholy, moldy coffee grounds needed dealt with. My ignorant mind said, "THROW THEM IN THE
    HOLE!", and down they went into the disposal. I turned it on and the hum of death went <i>brrrrrrrr</i>.
    Maintenance came by and found it wasn't the grounds, but it was sticks...sticks...from outside. My wife has
    collected sticks on occasion, and we believe our kitties must have dropped the sticks into the disposal as an act of
    rebellion.

    With my first-world problem resolved, I started on some pasta and meatballs. Vodka sauce has
    become a secret passion of mine. We found some vegan vodka sauce at Whole Foods, and the meatballs are just the
    Gardein branch frozen meatballs. I always make <a
       href="https://www.thekitchn.com/instant-pot-spaghetti-264230">pasta in the Instant Pot</a> and I can't
    recommend it enough.
    <br></br>
    With the pasta done and the rest of the Saturday ahead of me, I think I will daydream about making games and start
