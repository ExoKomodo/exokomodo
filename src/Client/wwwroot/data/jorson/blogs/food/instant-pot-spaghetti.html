          Sauté the beef. Turn an electric pressure cooker on to sauté. Once heated, add the olive oil and beef. Break the beef up into large pieces with a wooden spoon and season with the salt, onion powder, and garlic powder. Cook, stirring and breaking the beef into smaller and smaller pieces, until cooked through and no longer pink, about 5 minutes.
        </li>
        <li class="recipe-direction-item">
          Add 1/2 cup of the water, then the sauce. Turn off the sauté function and add 1/2 cup of the water to the pot. Scrape the bottom of the pot to remove any stuck-on bits. Add the sauce and stir to combine well.
        </li>
        <li class="recipe-direction-item">
          Break the spaghetti in half and layer in the pot. Break the spaghetti strands in half and spread them in one or two layers over the ground beef mixture. Do not stir from this point on.
        </li>
        <li class="recipe-direction-item">
          Add the remaining water but don’t stir. Rinse the pasta sauce jar with the remaining 1 1/2 cups water (pour the water into the jar, twist on the lid, and shake gently) and then pour the water over the pasta. Remember — no stirring here.
        </li>
        <li class="recipe-direction-item">
          Set the pressure cooker to HIGH for 8 minutes cook time. Seal the pressure cooker. Set to cook on HIGH pressure for 8 minutes. The cooker should take between 10 and 12 minutes to come up to pressure.  
        </li>
        <li class="recipe-direction-item">
          Use a quick release to release pressure and stir. Open the pressure release valve (quick release) as soon as the 8 minutes cook time is up. Open the pressure cooker and stir the spaghetti into the sauce. Turn off the pressure cooker and remove the insert from the pressure cooker. Serve immediately with a flurry of grated Parmesan cheese.
