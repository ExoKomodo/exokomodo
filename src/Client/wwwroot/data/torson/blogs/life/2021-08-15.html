    <p>Words, writing, and overly complicated thoughts have been my relationship to the world ever since I learned to read and finished speech therapy so people could understand me. Yadda yadda yadda, this is not the first time I've started a blog but it might just stick this time. I'm in a transformative part of life and getting to a place where I have more time dedicated to myself, which partly displays as writing out my experiences and feelings as a form of self care and decided vulnerability to the world. Speaking is still tough for me sometimes, but writing gives my brain the space to formulate and readress in a flashier fashion. That is, I think I sound more interesting over long form text than any other medium of communication. In recent years (since graduating college) my need to write in longform manner ceased, and electively I made attempts at journaling but as per usual my neurodivergent brain had trouble resuming the routine when interrupted, leading to sporadic entries. I like timeliness and order as a person, yet I struggle to maintain it on completely self-driven projects. If a third party is dependent on me for something, it will get done, but I fail to value my projects and time enough to pursue them independently. Rather than grind against this nature, I'm choosing to accept the cyclicly sporadic nature of my content creation and interests and just do something whenever I feel the urge. Otherwise I'm conditioned to endlessly plan and what if things and feel the need to perfectly execute some monetizable SEO perfect blog with a dozen entries from the getgo... which is just setting myself up to never sit down and do the 50 hours of work that would take me to make it feel good enough before even telling a single soul. Instead, here I am on a cute Blazer project setup by James ready to be a little less particular about what I write into the world.</p>
