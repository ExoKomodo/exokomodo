    <p>My first ventures into mom van life have gone less than stellar. When baby was about 3.5 months, I had to pull over twice driving the 18 miles back from the horse barn because my body-mind system could not handle the sound of her crying out of boredom and loneliness in the back seat. No amount of talking, singing, or promises of how soon we would be home can placate a small baby who cannot see their parent. She was fed and pottied just before departing, so it seemed she was just lonely (maybe she needed to burp, frankly that's been the hardest issue for me to diagnose as a mom). But on the second time pulling over, I climbed in the backseat on the carpool lane shoulder of 280 through downtown San Jose, accidentally kicking my Prius's gear shift into neutral, sending us rolling backward in my panic to comfort my baby in the backseat. Curse words filling the car's air, I got the car truly parked before facetiming my husband to talk me through getting the 13 minutes remaining home. It took a month for me to attempt leaving the house alone with my child again. We survived the 7 minutes to the Target parking lot, but the cries started when we turned in and I was in tears myself by the time I found a parking spot, which was too far from the entrance for the shopping cart to be pushed all the way to my car. On the way back, we took a wrong turn because of crying and had to yet again facetime dad to calmly talk us through getting the mile home. So it's been another month of relegating my trips out of the house to his schedule of being able to watch her or drive us all where I want to go. This means grocery shopping doesn't really happen, and I have yet to venture to wherever it is that moms go to make mom friends. Of course, groups and mama meetups have been suggested to me by an older pre-covid generation trying to help me out of this hole, but the missing piece is that I can't make it driving anywhere with child in tow. Now another month has gone by for my will to face my fears and try again. But with so much pressure on myself to leave the house, maybe I overlook a pottytunity and don't really secure the iPad I've finally decided to utilize as special car seat screen time, so it falls 4 minutes into our 13 minute drive and the potential energy of that effort goes to waste. We hit every long red light, and I visualize my cry-resistant coping shield blocking the noise, but 7 minutes later, 1.2 miles from my initial destination of the pet food and grocery stores, I abandon course and pull into the nearest parking lot with tears and comfort her. A shaken, quaking mess I text my partner a quick update. He calls, and assures me he can order the pet food for delivery and that I should try to enjoy the mall with baby, as she was due for a nap in a wrap anyway. Taking deep breaths and a step at a time, I jaywalked across the mall road as there was no reasonable pedestrian crossing from the market parking lot I ended up in, and had minimal effort left to give. Get to the froyo shop, and go from there. Baby conked in the carrier almost immediately, but 18 lbs strapped to my chest and the incessant echoing of coin operated ride music quickly becomes overstimulating for me. I consumed a bowl full of cold fruity sugar on my way to manage goal number two, purchasing forever stamps from the post office downstairs, not that we're mailing anything but because they won't get any cheaper. With a freshly sleeping baby, it's best to avoid conversations in loud places with strangers, so I wandered to the self service machine, and selected my options for forever stamps, expecting it to dispense the usual graphic stickers. Instead, after commiting to the purchase, it had to bypass and start printing QR code postage on thermal paper labels. Each label printed and cut individually, so my 20 count purchase and the slamming of the drop box label from the elderly woman next to us was too cacophanous in the tile and metal P.O. Box walls to let a baby rest. She was about 50 minutes into her rest on my chest, so while a sufficient nap for her I was overwhelmed by my suddenly less easily stored stamp hoard and hadn't had time to recuperate my mental state and figure out a next step or purpose for being at the mall, so my heart sank in my chest as it does when she wakes up before I feel ready. I hate that I feel like that, and want to naturally greet my child with joy when they wake, not be scaredly shushing a silent happy baby hoping they'll fall asleep when I know damn well that was enough sleep for a less stimulated baby and then the mom guilt cycle starts of feeling like I'll never know how to stay ahead of my kid and properly engage them to optimize development. I have all these tools (the internet) at my disposal, why aren't I the perfect super parent and early childhood development expert I want to be already? Time. Experience. Observation. Three elements I lack, which I can't rush. I can practice observation, by being more mindful in the moment and developing habits for myself like this of writing down my experiences and actively learning from them. Key word is active learning. I do so much passive learning by having a Curiosity Stream video playing in the background of my daily tasks, but I've disengaged from the active learning and reflection that so dearly sits with me. Writing out the reports for a science experiment always felt tedious to me when homeschooling, but that was definitely how the information locked into my brain. I had to experience it once, but then play it back through in my incredible short term visual memory and actually experience it again, observing and learning from it. Like watching a movie again, you notice more and connect mroe dots. This practice of reflecting and writing will help seal my day to day memories, and process the purpose of many life experiences that I've become too caught up in trying to maximize. Going to work on reliving my own life and being intimate with myself in that way. Letting myself dwell on what is. With an alert infant and temp sensitive stamps shoved in my fanny pack, I trudged back to the car, jaywalking again, just trying to breathe. Secured the iPad playing Frozen so it wouldn't fall again, and headed home feeling defeated with a dash of halfhearted accomplishment. She barely made a noise on the drive back, so the secured screen really might be my ticket to the world again.</p>
