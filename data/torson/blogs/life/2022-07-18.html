    <p>I gave birth for the first time nearly 6 months ago but I'm still struggling to feel like a mother. I quit my six figure career to rest the third trimester and be a stay at home mom. The vision was that I would immediately transform into a wizard matriarchal homemaker, who both knows what's for dinner and has the ingredients (and time and energy) to make it every night. Also lunch. And breakfast. In reality, meals get skipped and blood sugars crash and we lack the energy to clean a kitchen only to dirty it again so more energy is spent crying about it than is able to be used to form a long term solution. Help is needed, but I don't know how to articulate my issues, or where to even begin. I get distracted easily, but also need to have a tangible goal in mind to work towards. I feel so busy trying to keep our house somewhat clean and usable that I never feel I have a chance to look up before another week has passed, and oh the weekend has come, which means my partner is off work and able to help but the combination of wanting to finish things while I have a chance but also wanting to rest from full time babyminding means I end up in an anxious spiral of neither happening well. What I realized today is the hard part at this point is opening up at all. I'm in the throes of months-long postpartum depression, and feel mostly responsible for getting myself here, how true that is, I'm not sure. Incredible amounts of self restraint and biting my tongue out of learned shame responses has gotten me to this point. My dad once got mad at me for posting vague details about my home life on the internet when I was 14, declaring I was bringing shame to our family and lying. Now I'm 25 and still scared to post what I think on the internet for just anyone to read even though that's all I've ever wanted to do. I adored reading diaries, journals, and autobiographies growing up, and have always been inspired to make one of my own but failed to have the confidence in being interesting, pointed, concise, or consistent enough to make it worthwhile. Well now, I am a fully grown adult woman and mother, discarding shame and trusting my own intuition on what is and isn't okay to post on the internet. No, I am not at my best when writing this. But there are no definitions of what my best is anymore. There are no guarantees of progression, ever. But if something might work, like venting personal history on the fringes of the web, I should give it a go.</p>
