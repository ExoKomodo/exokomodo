    <p>Roommate birthday and finally taking time to think lands me writing again. Last time I worked on this site, two weeks ago, it was my husbands birthday - me getting back into some level of coding was the gift he wanted, so that's when he got me set up to write these on ExoKomodo since it's his passion project. Frankly I know I can benefit from it too, and having the encouragement of living with the guy who runs it helps me remember it exists. Eventually I may come up with some elaborate structure, tone, voice, and style for my blog posts but for now I simply need to get out of my own head and practice writing again. As a child I was a prolific reader and writer, but the demands of acadamia since I started college at 14 quelled my exuberance for language and communication beyond strict necessity. Sounds cheesy, but I've always felt like I was a 'writer' despite not actually writing much; how many thoughts have I had about writing? Since I'm on the autism spectrum, I think written words have been the most reliable form of communication. Without overthinking, I can express thoughts more fully, without feeling rushed and with just the slight restriction on flow by how fast I can write. I started lots of writing projects, diaries, journals, blogs, etc as a kid but nothing serial made it past three editions on any sort of regular timeline, accidentally abandoned by my neurodivergence. Writing these as a stream of conciousness, I hope to unlock parts of my inner dialogue that I've sealed in soundproof coffins for too long. By more actively letting go of my thought reins, I may undo some of my habituated anxiety. Old habits won't go away because you wish they would, only when you replace them with different behaviors. Part of the reason I'm writing this now is because I am establishing new routines to break old habits. Each day of the week has a theme or features - Monday is Media-Free (and for planning the week ahead), so we have app limits set on social and streaming media to encourage more creative or interactive activity. Thus, I'm writing and enjoying myself in a way that is not passively consuming the lives of others; instead I'm doing something with my own, even if it's as little as writing some sentences into an HTML file to push via VSCode. This is the wild frontier, we don't need your dang PressWord and SpaceSquares. Don't worry, I don't expect anyone to understand all of my references - except maybe James. Anyway, since it's our bestie's birthday I'm gonna DoorDash some food... maybe chikn wings, since last post was the Pilot. :) </p>
