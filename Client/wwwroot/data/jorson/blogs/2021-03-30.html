    Somehow my blog posting is more consistent than I expected it would be and that is sad. Like always, a lot has been
    going on in my life with much of it being generally positive. I am currently transitioning off of the team I started
    on at my work. I thought I would be more nostalgic in this moment, but I am simply relieved. Feature development for
    users is not my cup of tea any longer. I have been steeping myself deeper and deeper into different programming
    languages (primarily <a href="https://www.nim-lang.org">Nim</a> and <a href="https://www.elm-lang.org">Elm</a>) and
    even found a new code editor I intend to slowly replace <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com">VSCode</a> with (the
    editor is called <a href="https://github.com/rxi/lite">Lite</a>, but I am specifically using the <a
       href="https://github.com/franko/lite-xl">Lite-XL</a> fork). Needless to say, the technology I use in my life is
    in a constant state of change and I wouldn't have it any other way.
    <br></br>
    From a non-technical standpoint, I have some general exciting life updates! I have struggled with my weight for my
    entire life. I have been a vegan for the past few years, experienced some improvement in general with my health, but
    I was still struggling to fight my food addiction and lose weight. I had been spiralling in private, feeling
    hopeless and getting scared I would end up like many others around me who never got their weight under control.
    After watching the documentary <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt11295178">Diet Fiction</a>, I decided to remove
    processed foods from my life and eat just whole foods. Eating only whole foods has had both a physical and spiritual
    effect on me already. I was 277 lbs on March 5th, and over the course of this month I have steadily dropped down to
    262.2 lbs and I intend to keep going. My mood has improved, my energy levels have skyrocketed, and my understanding
    of food has changed forever.
    <br></br>
    My wife and I have also been making great progress on our backyard homestead and these two things combined are
    prompting me to think. As a Christian, I have been thinking about what eating only whole foods means from a
    spiritual perspective and my thoughts are best summed up in this nearly <a
       href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6rPPUmStKQ4">two hour documentary on YouTube</a>. As succinctly as
    possible, eating whole foods and my wife and I's work to grow our household's food are driven by an innate desire to
    connect with the roles and skills God imbued us with as stewards of the Earth. It is hard to argue against the
    damage humans have caused throughout all of history, and maybe the answer to humanity's environmental woes lies in
    the creation narrative. The spiritual aspects of this will not connect for everyone, but the benefits of growing
    your own food and consuming what comes from the Earth can be taken on their own merits.
    <br></br>
    Do I believe processed foods are inherently evil? No.
    <br></br>
    Do I believe you can't live a healthy life unless you only eat whole foods? Of course not.
    <br></br>
    Though, I leave you with a question to ask yourself: Why do humans act as if we are not a party <em>within</em>
    nature, but rather some strictly destructive <em>external</em> force on nature?
