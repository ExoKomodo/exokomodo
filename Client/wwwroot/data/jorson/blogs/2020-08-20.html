  <p>I have really been chipping away at this site for a bit. I have wanted a place to dump my thoughts and projects for
    a long time now, and it is finally here! Thank you for being willing to listen to my musings.

    Will I post at a consistent rate? Of course not, I struggle to remember to eat during a given day. Typing into this
    void of a webpage is going to occur when extra-special super awesome glints of mania push me to dump my thoughts.

    This first one was a short one, and far from the best one.
